Scripts
=============

* Some scripts and utilities that I have used in order to solve one or another problem :) *
- mac/checkpoint.sh : manage checkpoint firewall (cause problems with pptp connections)
- mac/ip-up: add automatically a network route in your system after a pptp connection has been made
